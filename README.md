Hello, you can call me Eicy or æ²™.

Although I don't know where you're from, I'm glad you're interested in me.

I'm trying to become an indie game developer or game designer, although having a company that makes games to make money may make me seem less "indie" in the future.

I make games to go and express my ideas, and I also treat games as a form of artistic expression.

I want to use games to write the stories I want to write, but a game is still a game, so fun is just as important.

I'm grateful to the people who have helped me on my journey, and I hope I can help you too.
